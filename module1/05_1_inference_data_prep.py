Module 1 - Step 5: Inference Data Preparation
==============================================

This is the FIRST JOB in the inference pipeline.

Takes raw inference data, applies the same feature engineering and preprocessing
transformations that were learned during model training, and outputs engineered
features ready for the prediction job.

Workflow:
1. Load raw inference data from inference_data/raw_inference_data.csv
2. Apply FeatureEngineer (creates engagement_score, age_groups, etc.)
3. Apply PreprocessingPipeline (scaling, one-hot encoding)
4. Save engineered/preprocessed data for the prediction job

Output: engineered_inference_data.csv (ready for model predictions)

Next step: 06_inference_predict.py
